# Six10 - Programming language
![Six10 Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IsacSvensson/Six10/master/Documentation/logo%20skiss.PNG)

This started as a summer project 2020 as I'd just finnished my first year att BTH's Software Engineering Programme. I started writing the project with its base in the Youtube series [Make YOUR OWN Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) by [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w). You can find Davids repository for his project [here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code). There where lots of bigger and smaller differences in the languages, but the main difference was that David wrote his in python and mine is writen in C++.

I'm now in 2021 and decided to start over from scrach, change from C++ to Python to handle strings and chars easier, to support multiple language.
