# Six10 - Programming language
![Six10 Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IsacSvensson/Six10/master/Documentation/logo%20skiss.PNG)

So, when the summer 2020 was comming up I wanted to do a big project to learn something new - so a programming language felt like a big but doable challange.
The project has its base in the Youtube series [Make YOUR OWN Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) by [CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w). You can find Davids repository for his project [here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code).
There are lots of bigger and smaller differences in the languages, but the main difference is that David wrote his in python and mine is writen in C++.
## Notes
* When I started working on the code I struggled with memory management. So this resulted not doing any clean up (Thinking I'm doing that later).. So now 3000 lines later - It's a mess.
* Most of the code is not pretty at all.. like I wrote above, It's a mess. Focus has been on making it work and learning how a programming language works.
* The language is far from done in any way. If you want to contribute, report issues, for the repo or what ever. Feel free to do so!
## Commands
There are in this moment three modes to run the application in:
* "-test" to test all functionallity
* "-shell" to run interpreter
* "folder\example.six10" to run a file.
